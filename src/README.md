# Source/Build Directory
This folder is where extraction/processing work is done before the converted 
version is moved to the `dist` directory. Once the build process is complete you 
should have one copy of the following:

	- `src/src` directory containing original source files
	- `src/dist`directory containing the partials used to create the HTML files 
	with `pypandoc`.
